Before starting the simulation:

step 1: Pray
step 2: Write the instructions in machine language in "uploader.bin"
step 3: Ensure that the logic-state, marked as "System_Clk" (in CLOCK block) is in
	state '0'

After starting the simulation:

step 0(optional): Drink plenty of water and go to wash room

step 1: Initially the logic-probe, marked as "BOOT_COMPLETE" will be '0'. Wait
	until it becomes '1'
step 2: Then press and release the "System_Clk" continuously...

Note: Do not bother with contention messages. Ignore them.
